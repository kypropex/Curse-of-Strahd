# House Durst
Before we went inside the house my companions decided to ask the children some
final details regarding what's happening inside. They managed to tell us, while
still in pain, that the parents and their smaller Bruder, a toddler by all
accounts, have been dragged in to the basement. They also mentioned that they
were braking a very important house rule of never leaving the premise because
of the monsters outside. This was plausible at the time given our experience
with the werewolves, but seamed odd in the aftermath.
This looked like a standard monster hunting mission; we have been in a couple of
them since we started this line of business.

As we went inside the open gate, I mentioned to Alaric that the kids seamed
untrustworthy and we should keep an eye on anything that might come at us from
behind; he agreed. Elona, although the sturdiest of our little bunch, was
unwilling to go first, can't really blame her. Thus Breker took the lead
followed by me, Alaric and Elona was keeping our backs safe. The front gate of
the estate was open.

The grand archway which present itself on the other side of the gate was a
clear first indication that this place the home of a wealthy family. Passed the
arching doorway we stepped in to the **grand foyer** where there were some
portraits of nobles hanging. In between them a beautiful shield with a
**coat-of-arms depicting a golden windmill on a red field**; this I gathered must
be the family crest.

The next room, I think the best way to describe it is by calling it the **main
hall**, had idyllic images of nymphs, forest and satyrs on the walls. To the
right of the of the entrance we came trough there is a fire place with a
longsword hanging above it, this also has the family crest on it. Opposite to
this fireplace there are some stairs leading up, this for our predicament, was
unfortunate as we were looking for a way to go down to the basement.
While Breker, Alaric and myself were in here trying to determine how to move
towards the basement, Elona decided to replace her shield with the nicer looking
one from the **grand foyer**. None of us minded has any comfort would help in
defeating the horror which befell this household.
