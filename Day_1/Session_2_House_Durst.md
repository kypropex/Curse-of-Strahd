# House Durst
Before we went inside the house my companions decided to ask the children some
final details regarding what's happening inside. They managed to tell us, while
still in pain, that the parents and their smaller Bruder, a toddler by all
accounts, have been dragged in to the basement. They also mentioned that they
were braking a very important house rule of never leaving the premise because
of the monsters outside. This was plausible at the time given our experience
with the werewolves, but seamed odd in the aftermath. They also mentioned a big library which really captured Alarics interest.
This looked like a standard monster hunting mission; we have been in a couple of
them since we started this line of business.

As we went inside the open gate, I mentioned to Alaric that the kids seamed
untrustworthy and we should keep an eye on anything that might come at us from
behind; he agreed. Elona, although the sturdiest of our little bunch, was
unwilling to go first, can't really blame her. Thus Breker took the lead
followed by me, Alaric and Elona was keeping our backs safe. The front gate of
the estate was open.

The grand archway which present itself on the other side of the gate was a
clear first indication that this place the home of a wealthy family. Passed the
arching doorway we stepped in to the **grand foyer** where there were some
portraits of nobles hanging. In between them a beautiful shield with a
**coat-of-arms depicting a golden windmill on a red field**; this I gathered must
be the family crest.

The next room, I think the best way to describe it is by calling it the **main
hall**, had idyllic images of nymphs, forest and satyrs on the walls. To the
right of the of the entrance we came trough there is a fire place with a
longsword hanging above it, this also has the family crest on it. Opposite to
this fireplace there are some stairs leading up, this for our predicament, was
unfortunate as we were looking for a way to go down to the basement. This particular room has some  other doors along the walls leading up to the stairs. The house, in most part (as is to be seen later) is clean and well maintained although no candles were lit and it left us with a feeling uninhabited.
While Breker, Alaric and myself were in here trying to determine how to move
towards the basement, Elona decided to replace her shield with the nicer looking
one from the **grand foyer**. None of us minded has any comfort would help in
defeating the horror which befell this household.

Breker opened the doors opposite to the ones we entered, while Alaric suggested that the most likely place we will find a way down stairs will be in the kitchen. The room Breker entered was the **Dining room**, with a set table (with plates and silver ware) for 8 people and a cristal chandelier hanging above. The walls had the same tapestry as the main hall with a fireplace in the same place as the previous room and a painting of a mountain valley above it. Similar to all the rooms before, there was no light in there, the fireplace was set and ready to be lit almost welcoming us to dare do it. 
As Elona joined Breker and myslef in this room I noticed that the walls next to the door we entered had two inconsistencies as if there would be two additional 1-2 person rooms there. To the right of the door mein Bruder discovered a coat room with black servants coats but there seemed to not be anything to the left wall (next to the fireplace). 

Breker and Elona inspceted the wall from both sides, very thoroughly. Our cleric maiden was the only one who discovered some strange things in the tapestry around that wall in both the **dining room** and **main hall**. By her account, in the main hall the images on the wall have serpents and skulls hidden within them while in the dining room there are mangled faces hidden in the tree trunks. Breker, Alaric and myslef could see nothing of this, which yet again confirms the uncanny perception of hers.

As we were busy with the wall Bruderchen explored the remaining rooms. He found the **kitchen and the pantry** to the left of the stairs with a small service elevator in the kitchen. He was curious to ride it, as he mentioned that it does look like fun, but I discouraged it because the house didn't feel safe yet. 

To the left of the stairs I entered in to sort of **hunting themed living room** with stuffed wolves, two armchairs in front of the fireplace with a small table between them. The room also featured a table with 4 places and two cupboards, one to the west of the room and one to the north. On the south side there were windows looking out, as I approached them looking for the children who should have been visible form this vantage point, I noticed that they were gone. Before leaving the room I decided to check the cupboards; the one on the westside was locked and I decided not to pry the other one had a pack of playing cards which took with me. 

In the main hall I met the rest of the party, whom I told about the hunting hall and the locked cupboard while suggesting to try our luck from the outside, maybe there is a way down from there. Breker said he will join us later as the idea of something locked intrigued him. 
Rest of us quickly discovered that it was easier to get in then get out. The main gate was locked and there was no way for us to open it. Breker came out with 3 crossbows and handed us each one with a bundle of 20 arrows for each, apparently these were hidden in the locke cupboard. He also determined that the front gate could not be unlocked and it was not kept locked by anything arcane rather something powerful of undetermined nature. Thus we had no other choice but to go up the stairs.

Cautiously we moved from the ground floor to the first floor where reached a similar hall as the main hall. This **1st floor hall** had 4 armored full plate suits with wolfs heads guarding it. Unser common thought (Alarics und mein) was that these have to cursed armors for protection of the estate, Elona suggested that they are aromor sets for werewolves.
At the end of the hallway on top of the fireplace there was a painting of the noble family. The two children we saw outside with their parents in the back, the father was holding an infant in his arm as the lady of the house is looking at it with scorn. As Breker took one of the iron wolf heads I took my time to contemplate on the painting. My impression was that it depicted  happy family but the mother's eyes sent shivers down my spine; for now I can only specilate that the infant is a illegitimate child of the father (this needs to be confirmed).
Alaric and myself entered the room on the right of the stairs (northern part of the house) while Breker and an uneasy Elona took the other side. We found the **library** while they found a **ballroom**.

By Elonas description, the **ballroom** had top to bottom mirrors on the walls with a harpsichord in the room.

The **library** was all that Alaric was hoping to find from the beginning. Him and Elona rummaged trough it finding history books of the family Durst, by all accounts the owners of this seemingly well maintained small mansion. The current lineage ends with the 3 Durst children; **Rosavalta** (the big sister), **Thornbolot** (the small child who was crying outside), ***Walter*** (the infant) and their parents **Elizabeth** and **Gustav Durst**.
The nameing of the children also suggest that the smallest child is somewhat different form the ones we have met so far, although he might not be a bastard as I assumed.

The last room, next to the library closest to the stairwell, proved to be a smaller **servants quarter** with 2 single beds with straw mattresses. This room is right above the kitchen and exactly the same size with the small service elevator leading up to this room. I pointed out the small size of the room compared to width of the library and the missing space where the pantry is downstairs, Alaric and Breker took it upon themselves to solve this new mystery. 
The way these two interact makes me think that mein kleiner Bruder might actually become friends with him; here is for hoping that we found somebody who not only tolerates him but actually likes him.

Meanwhile, I decided to take the lead (followed by Eloan) and went up to the next floor. As we reached the next floor the atmosphere suddenly and drastically changed. This part of the mansion was gloomy and very dirty compared to the rest of the house, the hallway was no longer straight but windy with on armoured suit guarding it. As I tried to get passed it became animated and attacked us, I got startled but this was no surprise as we have been expecting something like this for a while now. 

Elona and myself decide to run down and join the others. Strategically this allowed us to barricade in the library and we had better chances to defeat it this way. Breker created a small pool of oil in front of the library door (in the upper hall) as we passed through them, which made the armor fall prone giving us an advantage. Breker joined me in the front line. My cursed sword was hungering for the destruction of our enemy burning with desire of annihilation. This made me loose focus and thus I hit the target very few times. the Elona was doing hit and run attacks in the end Alaric was the one who did the most damage with his magic missiles. Breker damaged it with his metallic whip which in turn made the armor retaliate and knock the sturdy dwarf unconscious. My attempts to weaken the construct were in vane as my mind sliver did no damage to this mindless body. Lucky the radiant Elona used her knowledge in the healing arts to get Breker back in fighting shape, as Alaric used his last missiles to break the armor and the spell binding it together. 

This fight proved to be tougher then we thought, coupled with the hell of a day we had so far we decide to use the servants quarter and sleep it out ...
