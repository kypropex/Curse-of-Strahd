Two days ago my brother and myself were passing trough a small village in search
for work. Although it's been only a year since we started this business of
bounty hunting, our progress feels slow. Alaric, mein Bruder, is a bit skeptical,
about what good this will bring us in the long run but I feel that we are
already making a difference in the lives of all who we help out by ridding them
of the monsters and scum.

 We have arrived in the village late, therefore we decided to take a room at the
nearest Inn and search for work in the morning. While we were contemplating our
next course of action over some Ale and dinner, a very flamboyant man came in
and stared to speak in rimes; I must admit it was very entertaining. He stopped
at our table, we must have seamed out of place, and put a letter on the table
with an official seal on it; at that time I guessed it must be part of his
performance. Before we could ask for more details, he went to the Inn-keep
ordered food and drinks for all and stepped out in a haste.
It seams he left this letter only on our table. Alaric, being the more learned
of the two of us, quickly determined that the letter was written by somebody
versed in the calligraphic art, most likely a high ranking official or a noble
of sorts.

Letter reads:

***insert letter***

 Upon further inquiry I managed to find out from our host that this is a regular
occurrence and we might not be the only ones who got this letter in the past
weeks. We decided to follow up on the letter and travel trough the
***Svalich forest***. I must admit that the promise of wealth has got my brother
excited, my only hope is that we are not to late. So we set out to leave in
the morning....

 We have traveled the whole day long trough the forest, at our normal pace which
is slower then most because of Alarics height. As night was approaching a thick
fog was setting making travel even more difficult, but we figured that by
keeping to the road we must reach somewhere at some point.
A while after traveling trough the fog we heard the screaming of a lady down
the road we just came from. As we turned we saw a fair beautiful young Half-elf
dressed in full body armor running towards us. I quickly tried to determine if
she might be a threat, but the level of alarm and disarray she was in made me
think that its more likely she needs our help.
While approaching she was asking us to go back with her down the road because
she wanted to show us something. I tried to introduce ourselves and inquire
about the nature of the problem but she insisted that there is no time for
pleasantries as she was pulling us towards were she perceived the danger to be.
Alaric reluctantly followed as he is the more skeptical kind keeping an eye
on our new acquaintance.

 She lead us down the road to were the mist was thicker and said that there is a
portal there and that the portal brought here here to this strange place. Alaric
confirmed that that indeed is a possibility, but his patience was wearing thin at
this point so I decided we should put some distance between ourselves and this
place which was seaming increasingly less welcoming.
The unnatural thickness of the fog coupled with the dark embracing forest made
the atmosphere very tens. While setting up camp, mostly Alarics doing, I manged
to find out some more about our new "friend".

 Her name is Elona Norelor, she is a cleric of the order of **to be determined**,
although thought in the ways of the church, she doesn't seam to have much of
experience in practicing her believe outside her church and her books. Her
current mission was to rid a village near Dagerford of wolves which chased her trough
the portal to here; Elona swears that the wolves were not the typical kind and
that they were most likely  werewolves, which might be plausible.

 She seam to have bit of an arrogant part to her, much like Alaric, which lead to
some tensional moments between the two of them, specifically when she asked for
to borrow a book from him. Knowing my gnomish Bruder I was prepared for the
worst as he passed her a book in the basics of magic, knowing full well that she
must already have a good understanding of magic. Elona wasn't to happy about it
but accepted the book in good fate.

 While Alaric went to sleep I stayed up another hour to talk to her and calm her
down a bit, as she accepted to take first shift in guarding us. She seamed to be
trust worthy, I couldn't sens any mall-intent, so I went to sleep. Alaric woke
me an hour later as he himself has been awakened by a very frightened Elona who
saw a werewolf behind a tree. I guess she chose to wake my brother instead of me
because of my nightly reactions to my dreams. Upon investigating the spot she
mentioned we found the well tucked away cloths of a commoner which confirmed her
suspicion of werewolves. I got intrigued by her premonition about this and took
another couple of hours to determine if she is in any way connected to my dreams
and premonitions, but to no definitive conclusion.

During that night a new set of dreams has plagued me:

*Eye of a crow, followed by a light which was engulfed in darkness from which I*
*hear a scream which turn in a choir of screams and something whispering "release"*

 I wake up as always in a cold sweat but this time its not only myself and mein
Bruederchen sondern auch the wise Elona.
We follow the path towards Barovia, the village we set out to reach, while Elona
accompanies us as she has no better alternative for the moment. While we travel
we notice that the fog seams to be following us as we approach a giant gate
which is guarded by two giant stone statues with their head precisely severed.
On our way we notice different objects laying to the ground, abandoned in a hurry.
It feels like a caravan must have passed trough here in hast without stopping
to pick up anything that has fallen of the wagons.

 I pickup the first booklet I find in the hopes of determining who might have
these people been. I have little time to leaf trough, it seams to be an automatic
dream journal, as Elona picks up a music box which starts singing without ever
stopping. Alaric tries to "fix" it by trowing it away, and that it when we
notice that the fog which has been following us this far, is gaining speed.
I run back to fetch the music box as Elona is armored and Alaric is slow.She
insists that the music box might have a significance in what is happening, this
I cannot leave behind.

 The fog gains even more speed as we start running towards the gate. We barely
manage to close it behind us when we hear a loud "tud" as if something big and
heavy hits the wooden gate. On this side of the gate we find a corpse of a man
who has recently died with a second letter in his hand.

***insert letter***

 This one is in a different handwriting and feels less official the our first one.
We barely have time to gather our breath as we start to hear howling around us.
Elona hears 4 distinct wolves approaching, while our first instinct is to move
away, after a while I decide that we need to stop running and face our foes.
Today has felt like a day where we had been on a the run from the beginning,
enough is enough. This however proved to be a bad choice as we quickly notice
we are starting to be surrounded by 10.. 15.. 20 wolves, fighting is no longer
an option.

 While running for our lives, we hear carts in the distance from the back. These
have proven to be our salvation; I managed to jump in the first one as
Alaric und Elona mange to grab the second one. The driver of the cart,
***Stanimir*** is accompanied by a familiar dwarf.

 It took me while to recognize Breker Stoutsmith whom I met years ago while with
Alaric at a science fair for the most gifted young minds. Although Alaric won
the competition Breker was a close second at an even younger age then mein Bruder.
This usually means trouble, given my brothers temperament; I made a point back
then to remember Breker in order to ensure Alaric doesn't do anything...
reckless. The young dwarf has proven himself back then to be a gifted tinkerer
and meeting him here was indeed a surprise.

 ***Stanimir*** is a vistani, the first I ever met. Him and Breker are traveling to
Barovia where Breker needs to meat up with Madam Eva, the vistani leader and a
most talented fortune teller, regarding a curs of sorts. I asked ***Stanimir*** about
any information he might have on ***Kolyan Indirovich*** and handed him the first
letter I received. He told us that the flamboyant man, who I thought to be ein
Schauspieler, is named Arrigal and is in the service of somebody (I forgot,
it has has been a challenging day). It appears that we have been called under
false pretenses as the letter was probably not written by ***Kolyan Indirovich***
of whom ***Stanimir*** had a poor opinion. During this conversation, ***Stanimir*** offered me some of the best wine I had in my life, he mentioned that they do not
share it with anybody else but friends and family which lead me to believe that we
have been marked as friends by these strange people. Soon after I noticed Elona
puking from the other cart, Alaric shouted that it is nothing serious and it has
something to do with a vistana (female vistani) toe. Meanwhile Breker managed to
tell me that he was traveling with this group for the last couple of days (maybe
a week) and they seam like well meaning folk.

 The wolves were still on our heals but ***Stanimir*** in an uncaring fashion started
to present our surroundings, to the left of the road we were on is a 50ft wide
river ***Ivlis*** which seam to have some arching stone bridges crossing it at
certain spots. While to the right the majestic Svalich forest was still looming,
and down the road the village of Barovia (which confusingly is also the name of
the region) was waiting for us. The Light in this place seams to be very strange
as it had to be close or even past noon at this point, the sun was well hidden
behind a tick layer of clouds or something unknown. The grave and somewhat dark
ambiance we find ourselves in reminds me of the grim stories Frau Holle used
to scare us with.

 The wine was so good that I tried to negotiate a second flask form ***Stanimir*** but
he was not willing to part with a second one and even pointed out that we, Alaric,
Elona and myself are indebted to the vistani for saving our lives.
As we approached the village the wolves stopped following us and ***Stanimir*** felt
it to be safe to leave us close to Barovia; in a sign of gratitude I gave our
new friend a heart felt hug.

 As we were all traveling to the village, the best course of action felt that we
should stick together for now; thus Alaric, Elona, Breker and myself headed to
foot towards the village. On the outskirts of which we found a gloomy looking
house with two sobbing children hidden near it. The older girl was trying to
console the frightened little boy. My base instincts kicked in, to see such sorrow
such pain is to much for me to bear. I decided on the spot to help them, even if
Alaric would frown upon it.

 The children told us that there is a monster in the basement and they ran out,
the rest of the details are confusing as they stared to babble in a sobbing
voice about their parents somewhere in the house. It was comforting to see that
Alaric was also willing to help, I gather it might have something to do with the
him taking pity on them seeing how they might already be orphans, just like us.
The fact that the rest our companions have also decided to join in cleansing the
house has confirmed my suspicion that they are truly trustworthy travelers who
might even become friends in time.
