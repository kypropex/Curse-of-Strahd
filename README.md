# Curse-of-Strahd
The journal of Reineke van Holzburg

### Backstory of Reineke

I remember very little about my life before the orphanage; the sound of my
mothers voice, which was very warm and the sadness in my fathers eyes as they
decided to abandon me at age 3. This is my earliest memory.

I have no idea why they decided to do this, but it probably has to do do with
my "scars" (for a lack of a better word) on my back. They are on both sides of
my shoulder blades and radiate towards my arms as if my veins would have
lightning running trough them in does places. Our caretaker from the orphanage,
Frau Holle, told me to keep them hidden, that I am a haven touched, an Asimar
and that people might harm me if they knew that I am different. I don't know if
this is related with my scars but maybe this is why my parents decided to give
me away, maybe this is why I have these strange dreams of angels and wars.

The dreams .... they sometimes speak to me and feel more real then my own life.
Although in most of them I am the protagonist in some of them I am the silent
observer, they feel prophetic in nature and at the same time surreal. The language
which they are in, as I later in life learned, is Celestial. I could write
volumes on the visions that haunt me and on the feelings and premonitions they
confer. At this point however it's suffice to say that I feel something dark and
ominous about them.

My early life has been spent in the orphanage, where I quickly learned that the
best way to survive is to adapt and make friends while not loosing your sens of
self. My sens to protect my dear ones has always been strong. I guess Frau Holle
noticed that in me so she tasked me a mission of sorts, protect Alaric from
himself (and from others... although this is what I felt would be natural).

Alaric, mein Bruderherz as he as been mockingly refereed to since we were
inseparable, is a mischievous Gnome who likes to get in to trouble. Most of
these are usually do to fits of rage and a desire for revenge on those who
wrong him; this coupled with his grand ambitions of less noble intent  lead us
to some awkward situations. I try my best to make him more aware of other peoples
feelings and much more likeable for others, this however I feel is a endeavour
which takes time. He is the more scholarly type who likes to meddle in the gray
line between life and death. Even as young adults, I was better likes by the
teachers but I wasn't the most interested in their teachings (mostly because the
dreams keep me up during the night and during the day it's hard to focus) while
my brother absorb every bit of information he could get. I guess we all have our
strengths.

We became inseparable and made quit a team. As adults we did some odd jobs
throughout different cities in different apprenticeship schemes which usually  
would end in him getting bored and me insisting we leave before he gets any
vengeful thoughts. Until we finally meet Kolbaz, the antiquarian.


We got a job as clerks in his shop, it seamed like a standard job where Alaric
could find interesting things to learn about. Kolbaz at first seamed a bit to l
ighthearted never taking anything to serious and as far as I could tell, always
a bit tipsy. Mein Bruder tried to "cure him of his stupidity" as he put it, and
in doing so he tried to steal an old sword which was hidden in the attic. I
managed to find out and almost catch him in the act, but before he knew what was
happening I snatched the sword before he could touch it.
This has proven to be a mistake, as I touched the item I felt it binding to my
soul. My dreams became active during the day and my scars stared burning.
I felt the rush of energy flowing trough me as my visions showed me in countless
battles with essence of the sword in one hand and pair of glowing wings on my
back, slaying creatures of the night. As I regained consciousness my fury was
immeasurable, I decided we need to run and as we got to a safe place I stared
to explain the situation and for the first time show him my "scars". He got
silent as I was shouting and as he was understanding the gravity of the
situation.


During the same night as we went to sleep, Kolbaz found me. As he cast a
powerful sleeping spell on Alaric  he explained to me that he is an arch-wizard
undercover and he was keeping the sword as a prank which he was going to pull
on a "friend" of his. I explained the situation to him and then realized that
sword was far more powerful then he originally anticipated and that it will
give me some of its strength but at a cost.
As a bonus he said that the sword came with a "Monster hunterâ€™s pack" which he
is gracious enough to sell me. I think it was a ploy to get rid of some of his
old stuff, but I felt guilty about the sword and about my brothers way of acting
so I bought it for 33gp. As we said our fare wells he gave me an address to
write to him if I ever needed his help and keep in touch. In hindsight  he is
a good guy who like to live is life as best he can.


The next morning as Alaric woke up I decided that we should become bounty
hunters, as this would ease the burden of our deeds and help the communities
as well as give us a better reputation (which mein Bruder so desperately craves
for in order to get more power). He was reluctant at first but somehow I managed
to convince him about this course of action.


It's been a year of hunting as I started to learn about my new found abilities
and how to control and manage them. Although powerful they are still growing, I
can feel the immense potential in the weapon which also amplifies my haunting
dreams....
