# The innocent rest
We decided to descend in, what we assumed will be, the monsters den. As all
are clues so far have suggest we will face our true foe down there, thus we
decided to go about it cautiously. The plan was to have Alarics familiar lead
the way while we follow at a semi-safe distance and explore the basement level.
While Alaric was performing his hour long summoning ritual, I suggested we explore
the **big bedroom** on the second floor which Alaric (in rat form) has already
been trough. From previous experience with the house, there can be hidden clues
in different parts of the house which can only be seen while searching thoroughly
trough the room.

Breker, Elona and myself went back to the **big bedroom** while Myr, who was
acting a bit different from last night, was standing guard over Alaric as he
cast his dark spell. Our search has yielded results as we found on the dressing
table a jewelry box with a content that Breker estimates to be around 1000 gold
pieces. Although I was the one to  find it, I entrusted it to Brekers bottomless
bag as we shall split the profits at the end of the cleansing.

Back in the  **storage room** kleiner Bruder managed to invoke a e little
Fledermaus. We decided to have the bat fly ahead while Alaric was being carried
by me and was seeing trough the bat.

As the bat flew ahead, Alaric was describing the end of the downward spiral
which lead in to a corridor of dugout dirt reinforced with wooden pillars. The
way he described it, and the way we would later see it for ourselves, it appeared
like an excavated part of the house rather the a well thought trough basement.
The entrance area, to the left(east) and the right(west) was clear of any
creatures thus we descended cautiously. Alaric decided to explore further in
Fledermaus form the rest of this Keller, which was proving to be more of a
maze then we initially thought. Never the less we were moving as a unit, ready
to be ambushed at each and every corner. As Batlaric (Alaric the bat :P) flew
west, the rest of our merry party: Breker, Myr myself carrying my gnome brother
and Elona, went east. We kept our marching single file in the order mentioned
before hand.

To the west, Alaric described a series of rooms with the closest being a **mess**
**hall** with animal bones on the ground, followed by corridor which branches of into:
1. a large room with a statue, surrounded by skeletons, holding an orb.
2. a hallway leading to a room with a table and two chairs, beyond which, to
   the left was a bedchamber with a large bed in it

He also described some stairs which are leading further down to a **second**
**underground level** to the north of the branching corridor, from where draconic
chanting could be heard.

While he was so vividly describing his bat surroundings I was dutifully carrying
him to the east of our entrance. In the far south-eastern corner of the **"basement"**
we found two open crypts, one that was empty and had no writing on the stone
slab which served as a door and the second one, also empty, with Walters name
on it. As soon as I saw the name, something inside me boiled up to the surface
an emotion of sadness and fear which were not mine. Thorn, within me was
overcome with these emotions as he fondly remembered his little brother, these
then enveloped me in the same feelings I have for Alaric. Thus I shook my little
brother awake from his bat conscious, my pretext was that we found a crypt
which he might be interest in, but in reality I just wanted to see that he was
alright... I fear that these feelings might lead me to rash decisions in the
next fight if I can't put Thorn to peace by then. Alaric went back in to his
bat exploration.

We proceeded to the north, down some stairs only, to find ourselves in a large
room with five smaller bedchambers in it. As Myr, Breker and Elona inspected the
rooms I was guarding Alaric who was describing the large bedchamber at that point
in the far western corner of our maze. I lay him down on the wooden table in the
room and drew my sword, ready to react if need be. The gang found some trinkets
in the coffers of the rooms, most notably of them being an eyepatch with a jewel
sown in to it and a slivers shortsword. Our conclusion was that this chamber/s
must be a **common sleeping quarter** to the one chanting down in the lower
chamber. As we did not want to explore further into the dark depth of our maze
we decided to double back and explore the rest of the crypt.

I woke up Alaric as we reached the other four crypts next to the place we entered
**"the basement"** (which is clear now that is something more). Here we found
Rose and Thorns crypts sealed to the north. I insisted on opening them and
checking if anybody was buried in them, the others were reluctant. With Myrs help,
because Thorns sadness overwhelmed me again, I managed to open the little boys
tomb in which we found an empty stone coffin. The same was true for the adjacent
tomb of Rose. I convinced Myr to lay Thorn and Rose to rest in their rightful
places, in the hopes that this will help the little boy in me feel some much
needed comfort. As we ran up the five floors of stairs and transported them
down to the crypt in their bedsheets, I felt that we were doing the right thing.
Upon the time we finished our task, while Elona muttered a prayer for Thorn and
Rose, Myr and myself felt a relief as our uninvited specters left us. While
leaving us, they bestowed a small blessing on our group, for our help in
bringing peace to their final journey. To be honest, although I disliked being
possessed against my will by a frightened little boy, I must admit that knowing
I made a difference to him, that we managed to free his spirit from the torture
it was going trough has brought me more fulfilment then Alarics apprenticeship
schemes.

With the refreshing blessing and some inspiration, I decided to check out the
last crypt, of Elizabeth and Gustavs next to hers. My companions were reluctant,
again, but I suggested that if we might find something in the coffins, this will
confirm once and for all that they might not be involved with the creatures down
here. Unfortunately after opening Elizabeths tomb, while checking her coffin, we
got attacked by a swarm of centipedes. I barely managed to seal the slab behind
me as they were attacking us ruthlessly, sealing them in the tomb. On the
insistence of the rest of the group, I decided to forgo opening Gustavs crypt.

We headed in to the **mess hall** where we heard some animalistic noises coming
from the southern most wall. Upon closer inspection Myr found a worm like
creature in the wall, which we decided was better not to disturb.

Alaric insisted he wants to check out the **statue room** where we found, as
he previously described, mossy skeletons surrounding a statue holding a glowing
orb. So far this room has also proven to be the only room lit up by torches
surroundings the statue, giving the room an even more ominous feeling of the occult.
The assumption was that the orb is magical, which, naturally, peaked his
interest. While Alaric, Myr, and Breker were trying to get to the orb, which
was some way above the ground out of reach even for our dancing half-elf, myself
and Elona focused on inspecting the skeletons. My main concern was that this
looked like the sacrifice room that was mentioned in the letter found in the
house, thus these skeletons might be guardians of sort. These however have seen
chained to the walls long while ago, moss was growing on them and even the chains
themselves were extremely rusty. In the far east corner of the room behind the
last skeleton I barely managed to make out a old, moldy, worn wooden door.
Prying it open was not difficult, keeping it from falling apart seemed more of
a challenge though. It uncovered stairs leading up, hopefully back up to the
house as climbing the stairs we cam trough is a task in it's own. I tried in
vane to tell my companions about it, as all except Elona were to focused on getting
the orb. It has gotten to the point were Myr had lifted Alaric on her back just
to get to it. I told Elona I will go ahead and investigate the stairs and were
they lead.... as I uttered the words Alaric managed to touch the glowing sphere.
I was wrong; the room was protected but not by the skeletons. Out of nowhere
five shadows appeared and started attacking the ones closest to the orb as they
were clearly there to guard the unholy item.

The fight ensued pretty quickly as Myr, Breker and Alaric where the closest to
them. Unfortunately their proximity to the conflict took them by surprise,
besonders Alaric who likes to keep his physical distance as much as possible and
attack from a safe distance. I, however, was quick to react with my mind sliver
on the one closest to Alaric. Although I felt it inflict some damage it was clear
that these will prove to formidable adversaries. While taking hits Breker and Myr
fought back with determination, but in the end Elona was the most efficient of us
all. Her radiant spells have proven to be no match for the dark nature of these
creatures. Alaric managed to get to a safe distance as Breker positioned himself
in the middle of the room using his makeshift metal whip to both inflict wounds
and pull his enemies away from the one following Alaric. Myr and myself stayed
in the front lines fending off the majority of the shadows. I noticed during the
fight when Alaric, Breker or even Myr got hit that they appeared to be weakened
by the shadowy strikes, it was only when I myself got hit that I understood the
gravity of the situation. The shadows hit drained strength with every strike,
whit each blow it was harder to move and to carry oneself. On top of this, my
strikes had very little effect, as they proved to be immune to the damage dealt
by my hex and resistant to my cursed sword. In the end I did not manage to
kill any but I did mange to prime them for Elona and Alaric. Myr handled herself
well although by the end of it she looked the worst.

It took us under a minute to dispatch of them but by the end, all of my colleagues
were in very bad shape. As a child I had innate healing skills, which in these
situations have proven to be vital. Alaric was already being taken care of by
our cleric and I deiced to use my skills to help Myr up as she was clearly the
one who needed it the most.

Exploration of the stairs leading up has proven to be fruitful. At the end of the
stairs we found a small ladder leading to a trap door, above it we found ourselves
in the **hunting room** on the ground floor. As almost all of was were in no
condition to carry on, we decide to go back to the room we slept in and take
a rest for the *night(??)*. Since we have gotten here the fog has proven to
be more then a nuisance as telling time in our surroundings is almost impossible.
Either way... rest was sorely needed. Thus we went back up stairs...
