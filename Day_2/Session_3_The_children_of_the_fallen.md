#The children of the fallen
>*I'm falling from the sky at a very high speed, before I can get my bearings I *
*hit the cold salty water sinking rapidly. Swimming doesn't help something is pulling*
*me in to the depths. I reach the darkness where I stop and two giant yellow eyes*
*greet me. From within the depths I hear a voice:*

Violently I awaken from my dream coughing up salt water, this is the first time
I almost die from one of my dreams. Everything in it was so real so close to me
that I fear one of them will be my undoing soon. It might be the house, or even
Barovia itself which messes with our magic and this appears to be messing with
my dreams as well. When I get the chance I will have to ask Alaric if he has
read about spells which can induce and alter dreams and if these spells can be
used to kill you.

Alaric notices me struggling to breath and rushes to my aid although there is
very little he can do. The rest of my companions seam to have been interrupted
from their morning preparations as I am the last one to wake up. For Elona this
is nothing new as she has seen me violently weak up, still she seems concerned;
Breaker is unmoved from his basteln and Myr is silently observing us probably
unsure of what to make of our small group.

I manage to catch my breath and get a hold of myself as Breaker and Elona, who
was helping him, finish their little projects. He has managed to improve on his
armor and create a bottomless bag, like in the stories Frau Holle used to tell
us as children. Myr calls him the nifty one, and I must admit that he is proving
to be extremely handy with building and breaking things.

Him, Elona, Myr and myself headed out in to the hallway as Alaric started drawing
something on the ground in the sleeping room and prepared to focus on a new spell.
This is noting new, has he as some crazy ideas sometimes which just come to him.
I told him not to do anything stupid and that I want so check out the **secret**
**room** in the library. He dislikes the teasing but did not want to break his
concentration on the spell, one of the few moments he has no snarly reply to what
is being discussed :D. As I passed the **upper hallway** I made a remark to
Breker and girls that there is something very wrong with the painting in this
room, hinting at the fact that **William** is most likely a bastard and this
might be connected to the curse on this house. Breker did not seemed to mind as
he was busy dismantling an armor and stuffing it in his bag.

I took my time in inspecting the **secret room** which proved to be as Alaric
described. There was nothing interesting in the room, at least not for me, and
thus I decided to check the cupboards in the **library**. In one of them I found
a key, which Myr suggested might be the key to the main gate, but I did not dare
to hope as it was clear to me that the gate will not open unless we cleans this
place.

Back in the **upper hallway** the girls were assisting Breker in his acquisitions
as Alaric stepped out of the sleeping room with a "friend" on his shoulder. Die
Ratte which he most likely conjured was his familiar, it obeyed his commands
never leaving Alarics side unless a command was issued.
