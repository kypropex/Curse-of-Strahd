# The children of the fallen
>*I'm falling from the sky at a very high speed, before I can get my bearings I *
*hit the cold salty water sinking rapidly. Swimming doesn't help something is pulling*
*me in to the depths. I reach the darkness where I stop and two giant yellow eyes*
*greet me. From within the depths I hear a voice:*

```
Some art able and as willing, pay
The rigid satisfaction, death for death
Say heavenly powers, where shall we find such love,
Which of ye will be mortal to redeem.
Which thy chose One sacrify flesh and soul for power.
Or bring upon everyone's eternal damnation.
A choice must be made!
Release! Release! Release!
```
Violently I awaken from my dream coughing up salt water, this is the first time
I almost die from one of my dreams. Everything in it was so real so close to me
that I fear one of them will be my undoing soon. It might be the house, or even
Barovia itself which messes with our magic and this appears to be messing with
my dreams as well. When I get the chance I will have to ask Alaric if he has
read about spells which can induce and alter dreams and if these spells can be
used to kill you.

Alaric notices me struggling to breath and rushes to my aid although there is
very little he can do. The rest of my companions seam to have been interrupted
from their morning preparations as I am the last one to wake up. For Elona this
is nothing new as she has seen me violently weak up, still she seems concerned;
Breaker is unmoved from his basteln and Myr is silently observing us probably
unsure of what to make of our small group.

I manage to catch my breath and get a hold of myself as Breaker and Elona, who
was helping him, finish their little projects. He has managed to improve on his
armor and create a bottomless bag, like in the stories Frau Holle used to tell
us as children. Myr calls him the nifty one, and I must admit that he is proving
to be extremely handy with building and breaking things.

Him, Elona, Myr and myself headed out in to the hallway as Alaric started drawing
something on the ground in the sleeping room and prepared to focus on a new spell.
This is noting new, has he as some crazy ideas sometimes which just come to him.
I told him not to do anything stupid and that I want so check out the **secret**
**room** in the library. He dislikes the teasing but did not want to break his
concentration on the spell, one of the few moments he has no snarly reply to what
is being discussed :D. As I passed the **upper hallway** I made a remark to
Breker and girls that there is something very wrong with the painting in this
room, hinting at the fact that **William** is most likely a bastard and this
might be connected to the curse on this house. Breker did not seemed to mind as
he was busy dismantling an armor and stuffing it in his bag.

I took my time in inspecting the **secret room** which proved to be as Alaric
described. There was nothing interesting in the room, at least not for me, and
thus I decided to check the cupboards in the **library**. In one of them I found
a key, which Myr suggested might be the key to the main gate, but I did not dare
to hope as it was clear to me that the gate will not open unless we cleans this
place.

Back in the **upper hallway** the girls were assisting Breker in his acquisitions
as Alaric stepped out of the sleeping room with a "friend" on his shoulder. Die
Ratte which he most likely conjured was his familiar, it obeyed his commands
never leaving Alarics side unless a command was issued. Alaric then expressed
his desire to study the books in the **secret library**, this alarmed me as he
tends to get in to trouble even without doing complex necromancy, with these
books this might lead to some very bad outcomes. There was however no swaying
him, the passion with which he started to explain the different ways to
resurrect creatures and the way he described that the soul doesn't matter
makes me think that he will go down a darker path soon, hopefully I can still
save him before this gets out of hand. As he starts looking trough the books I
know that there is no more talking to him, so I decided to check up on the rest
of our group.

Breker and Elona have started chatting about some letters they have been writing
to each other, apparently they just discovered that they are pen-palls and have
been for some time now, this would be the first time they met in person. Meanwhile
I noticed that they managed to secure a complete armor set and I suggested that
the sword from downstairs would go well with the suit. Thus I rushed down and
brought it to Breker to add it to his collection. I guess now that house Durst
is most likely dead or soon to be dead if they try to kill us, they will not
mind us for taking our compensation for the job.
As we finished our task from the library we heard a nose of frustration; Alaric
had just discovered, to my ~~delight~~ relief, that the necromancy books were
all wrong. It appears that the Durst family are "all posers" as he put it, and
was now determined to take his revenge on them for giving him false hope.

We formulated a plan, by Bruederchens suggestion, to send his familiar down the
elevator to the basement and have him explore as Alaric could see trough the
familiars eyes. This spell is use full unfortunately it renders the user blind
while he sees trough the eyes of the familiar. Thus we laid Alaric down on the
bed and I went out of the room, but still in hearing distance, to guard against
potential intruders. While Breker was operating **the elevator** the two
half-elves were listening to Alaric describe what he was seeing trough the rats
eyes.

The **elevator** did not go down further then the ground floor, this was highly
unfortunate. We decided he should explore the next floor instead. The **elevator**
lead in to a **large bedroom** which was dusty, as the rest of the **second floor**,
with an old tiger rug in poor condition in front of the fire place. There was a
table with two chairs, two dressers next to a double large bed and a table with a
mirror on it and chair next to it. As it seamed uninteresting, we suggested he
to the next room. Thus Alaric, the rat, slid under the double doors and across
the hall on to the **bathroom** which was a standard high class bathroom with
a stove and a wooden tub ... fancy.
Next to the bathroom there was a **utility closet** which proved to be fatal for
Alaric the rat, as it attacked the second it saw the rat and killed it. Alaric
woke up from his spell and we decide that it was safe enough for us to go up.

As we already knew half of the layout of the **second floor**, the decision was
made to look in the other rooms and avoid the ones we knew about, especially the
bad broom closet, which has be dobbed **broomba** (broom bad). As we prepared
to enter what seemed to be the last room, I decided to study the wall next to
this room as it was unusually full of cobwebs. My inquisition yielded immediate
results as I have found a hidden passage which leads up even further. We however
decided to finish exploring this floor before proceeding.
I boldly opened the door to what later proved to be the **nursery**, where I was
greeted by a hostile ghost. i shouted to the rest of the group to watch out
as I blasted it with a mind sliver. Myr positioned herself next to the outer door
ready to ambush the creature as it would come out. The specter tried to hit me
in vain as I manged to parry and doge it's attacks leading it outside. As soon
as it was in Elonas visible range she blasted it in to pieces rendering Brekers
and Alarics preparations useless. Our young cleric is proving to be more capable
then any of us expected, given her bookish nature.

The rest of the **nursery** proved to be a simple room with a bed a dresser and
two tables on each side of the bed. The room had a smaller room next to it
with a crib inside. Upon closer inspection I called Alaric to look at the crib
as there was a small fully covered bundle laying in it. Alaric opened the bundle
and as he did it fell apart in his hands as if the spirit of an infant had just
diapered. This has further led me to believe that young master **William** is
somehow in the middle of this whole curse. Nothing else proved to be useful, so
we proceeded to the **last floor**.

Passed the cobwebbed wooden staircase we found a hallway multiple closed doors,
but one of them in particular was locked with a massive lock from the outside.
Breker did not hesitate to pick the lock as soon as he saw it, although it was
unnecessary as the key I found in the **library** was a match for this lock.
What we found inside has proven to be yet another burden for me....
As we entered the room the first thing we saw were the skeletal remains
of two children, one of which was clutching a teddy bear. The rest of the room
had two opposing beds in the back, to the left a dollhouse sized replica of the
house we have been exploring and to the right a chest with toys. This had to be
the **childrens room**. Alaric, of course, went straight for the bodies and
tried to remove the teddy from the skeleton which triggered the ghost of the two
children to appear.

In front of us the two ghost of **Rose** and **Thorn** manifested themselves.
This apparitions however were different from the things we met outside, they were
genuinely afraid and confused. Thus proving that those things which trapped us
in this cursed house have nothing to do with these innocent children.
Breker started exploring the dollhouse while Alaric examined the skeletons, Elona
was looking trough the room, Myr and myself started talking to the children.
They knew very little about what had happened in the house, their last memory
being their parents locking the doors from the outside with the key as per usual
during the night. This proved to be their undoing as they subsequently died of
hunger here, in their room, forgotten and abandoned. In our conversation **Thorn**
has proven to be a scared little boy, initially afraid of me while being protected
as best as she could by **Rose**. This at least was similar to the "children"
outside.

After Alarics autopsy Breker discovered by studying the dollhouse, a hidden
passage from a **storage room**, which was next to this room, down to the
basement. Breker suggest we salt the bones of the children and give them a
prover burial to free their spirits, but he did not take in to account that we
cannot get out of the house yet. I promised him we would do that as soon as we
could. As we decided to move on from here and proceed to the basement, I turned
one last time to children to reassure them that we will do our best to avenge
them. This triggered a very emotional state in **Thorn** who started clutching
my foot begging me not to leave and thus bound himself to me... yet another
voice in my head. Myr tried to stop the little boy but this has also proven
to be mistake because that prompted **Rose** to attache herself to Myr.

I can feel the fear and storm of emotions which defined this little boy who
know is part of me. Until I learn how to deal with this new challenge or until
I free their sprits by cleansing the house, I will probably not be able
continuously suppress **Thorn** thoughts...

The rest of the floor has proven to be even more dusty the the previous floor
(I don't know how that's possible). It has two guest rooms with a bed, a dresser
small tale and a chair. The **storage room** has crates and chests covered with
white sheets, in one of the trunks we found the skeletal remains of the nurse,
stabbed multiple times with was Alaric assumed was a knife, nothing else could
be determined about her, as Breker observed, a hidden passage to a staircase
leading down....
