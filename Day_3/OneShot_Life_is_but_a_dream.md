# Life is but a dream
"We need your help", a voice resounded in my mind as everything around me was frozen in time. From the other room I heard Breker being confused and Alaric responding in equal confusion about what is happening. "Help us" the voice went again. "Quid pro quo" I replied. Less then 10 seconds later a white light engulfed me as I woke up in the middle of the battlefield with Alaric and Breker beside me.

The burning battlefield was littered with corpses of both angelic and demonic figures as the air around us was dens and heavy to breath. The tree of us were looking around confused trying to figure out what was happening. Before I managed to explain what I knew about getting here, we saw a giant blue figure, with a stern cold look on it s face and wings on its back coming towards us while killing winged demonic creatures with his 10ft long greatsword in its path. "They took **Saureya**" he said as he saw us confused in the middle of an epic battle, "We need your help to get her back". "Ok? I guess this is why we have been pulled here, I guess" I replied still unsure about why we were summoned to one of nightmares. The blue enormous angel proceeded to call three massive lions with wings bound by chains which he urged us mount.

I helped my little dwarven friend Breker and my little gnome brother on to their lions after which I mounted mine. All of them unchained their wings as we took of from this place of death. From above we could see the formation of angles cutting trough the ranks of the demons towards their unholy fortress which was swarming with their corrupted presence. We however were following the blue winged giant away from the fortress along the dark abyss which seemed to be following as a river. This was real, we were in one of my nightmares, the fighting I dream about since I was a child, the eternal struggle between these two factions was now more palpable to me as ever before.

I quickly explained to Breker and Alaric that we are in fact in one of the things that scenarios that keep me from having a good night rest. While Alaric understood the situation we found ourselves in, I had to clue Breker in by explaining to him that I am an Aasimar and thus celestial by nature. Breker was fascinated by this new discovery about myself, making a not so subtle note to study me when he got the chance.

There were still many unanswered questions, thus I started with the most obvious one by asking our blue friend for his name. "**Ramiel**" he replied. I asked him about **Saureya** and why I was summoned to rescues her as he explained the she is my guardian angel and she is invaluable to the celestial kind, it was her who brought us her and that it was imperative for us to save her at all cost. I suggest that we will do our best, but we might not be of much help in the state we are as we have also been rippled out of the middle of a fight. He proceeded to generate a cloud of glittering dust which covered us healing our wounds and invigorated us as if we would have just woken up from the most peaceful sleep.

We were traveling up the abyssal river, which he warned us was bottomless and infinite in its nature, urging us to not drop of the lions. **Ramiel** did not finish his thought as we got ambushed by a squad of winged creatures. Most of them attacked him as two of them were coming for us. Breker was using his whip to keep them at bay, while I was using my hex curse on the one between my lion and Alarics. I noticed that Breker was managing his foe well thus I started assisting mein Bruder as best as I could. Finally his necrotic attacks were having the desired effect on these creatures I was beginning to fear that Alaric has lost his touch to defend himself. The cursed house is full of undead things which are immune to his particular brand of offensive strikes. As I tried to hit the demon, I lost my footing and almost fell down, Breker managed to disarm the creature who was focusing on him and took the opportunity to come and rescue me from certain eternal damnation. Meanwhile Alaric managed to inflict some damage to his demon which switched its focus form Alaric to his mount, latching itself to the troth of the lion and wounding it continuously. Breker flew back distracting the other demon while we managed to kill the demon attacking the lion but it was to late, the lion was mortally wounded and was going down. Alaric barely managed to jump and latch himself to my lion as Breker killed the last demon. I helped Alaric up on to my lion with grate effort. This was our first aerial combat and for myself and Alaric it was almost our last.
