# Choices (part 2)
We woke up in the "morning", I guess, as it was still impossible to tell time in
this awful place we were trapped in. Thus we decided to continue in exploring
the depths of the **basement**. There was no point in going back to the freshly

burnet room thus we went exploring the **lower parts of the basement**. We found
a second common sleeping room with some personal trinkets of the ones who used
to live and pray(?) here. finding nothing of interest Batlaric started to
descend further down a flight of stairs he found leading to a very peculiar room
with 13 exhibits on pedestals placed in a very ritualistic fashion around the
room.

Naturally my little gnome brother wanted to grab one, but given our previous
experience with touching forbidden things, he quickly come to realize that it
might not be a wise decision. To the south-east of the room there was a
portcullis leading to a semi-flooded room with an alter in the middle of it. The
portcullis however did not open from this side. Chanting could be herd from that
room although nobody was in there.
```
"He is the ancient. He is the land."
```

Further inspection of **exhibition room** revelated a second entrance to the
west of the room. This room was accessible and had proven to be the **dungeon**.
Within this place we found a dead skeleton dressed in a ceremonial robe, he was
laying in the biggest cell on the northern part of the dungeon. In to opposite
cell from him we found a weakened wall which with some combined strength we
managed to demolish and get in to the actual **altar room** (who am I kidding
Elona toppled the wall).

As we entered the room, chanting stopped. The murky water which filled the room
proved to be keen high and covered everything except for the Altar in the middle
and the ledged around the room. On the west side of the room (opposite end of
the portcullis) a pile of bones lay as if discarded like garbage. Near the
portcullis there was a leaver which Breker went to inspect as the two half
elves, Alaric and myself went to see the altar up close.

Stone stairs lead up the octagonal pedestal on top of which the altar lays. As
Alaric stepped on the stairs the chanting resumed:
```
One must Die! One must Die! One must Die! One must Die! One must Die!
```
This new set of chanting was accompanied by 13 dark figure floating on top of
the room. Each figure was holding a torch with black flames which did not seam
to emanate any light. The altar had dry blood on it making it clear that this
was not the first time it was used.

This was it for me, I knew this was the choice that has to be made. I could feel
the blade trusting in my hand, the chanting in the air drawing me in to
sacrifice something. I had to be resolute if my guardian angel was right the
choice had to be mine, unleash the unknown and maybe corrupt myself in the
process or keep it hidden and risk somebody else suffer my own fate. As I
pondered my choice Alaric felt bored and the girls were inspecting the altar.
Mein Bruder climbed down the pedestal and was going towards the pile of bones as
I made a decision.

I felt that the best course of action was to unleash the demon in the sword and
purify it while it was in my possession. It was clear to me that the sword had
been presented to us as a challenge, that it wanted to be used to kill but that
doesn't mean it cant be used to do some good.

As Alaric went down the stairs I asked him sent the bat over to me and listen to
my commands. The bat lay in front of me, on the stone slab filled with old blood
stains. As I raised the sword plunging it in to the summoned creature. The
figures disappeared the chanting stopped and so did time as a childish voice
asked me a simple yet eerie question:
```
Do you wanna kill some evil?
```

I was astound at this but my astonishment lasted very little as time resumed
only for me to notice that small gnome reached the pile of bones awakening one
of the greatest terrors we faced so far.
